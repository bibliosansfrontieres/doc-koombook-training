## When to use it 
The KoomBook can evolve and adapt to different contexts; even environments where electricity and the Internet aren't available! Its on-board battery allows it to function without charging for hours on end. The KoomBook and its integrated software also allow users access to learning programs and resources asynchronously, without internet connection.

Thanks to these capabilities, the KoomBook easily supplements teachers' course material and activities such as workshops. The emphasis on the accommodation of local programs gives educators and users control over its implementation.

The local focus of the KoomBook means is not designed to widely disseminate information; the interface authorizes 15 users at a time. 

The KoomBook also allows for the projection of media content via a video projector. This function is particularly useful in classroom and university settings.
